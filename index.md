## Howdy Hey!

I'm some sort of <span class = "linear-text-gradient">software engineer</span>.

I'm a student at RIT, simultaneously pursuing a <span class = "linear-text-gradient">Bachelors</span> and <span class = "linear-text-gradient">Masters</span> in Software Engineering in my second year.

I'm looking for a full-time paid internship or co-op between May 2025 and August 2026 (That's 15 months).

I'm pretty good at **Python** and **Java**;
Plenty adequate in **C**, and **Javascript**;
Learning **Mathematica**, **Matlab**, and **Rust**;
Want to Learn ~~**OCaml, COBOL, GLSL, Haskell, Kotlin**~~ <span class = "linear-text-gradient">everything</span>.
