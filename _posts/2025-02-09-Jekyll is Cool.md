I finally got around to making this website and since the last time I used github pages github switched to using Jekyll for them.
I kind of miss making a terrible static html website by hand, but deploying from Markdown is actually really cool.
I don't really have anything so say but I guess if you bothered to read this I'm currently averaging 85 words per minute on a traditional keyboard with 80g switches and about 50 on the split with the same switches.
